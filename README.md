# BACKEND Stage 2 Task: User Authentication & Organisation
Using your most comfortable backend framework of your choice, adhere to the following acceptance:  
**READ CAREFULLY!!!**  
Acceptance Criteria  
Connect your application to a Postgres database server. (optional: you can choose to use any ORM of your choice if you want or not).  

## CREATING A USER
###  Create a User model using the properties below
_NB: user id and email must be unique_
```json
{
	"userId": "string" // must be unique
	"firstName": "string", // must not be null
	"lastName": "string" // must not be null
	"email": "string" // must be unique and must not be null
	"password": "string" // must not be null
	"phone": "string"
}
```
Provide validation for all fields. When there’s a validation error, return status code **`422`** with payload:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "string",
      "message": "string"
    },
  ]
}
```
_Using the schema above, implement user authentication_
#### User Registration:  
- Implement an endpoint for user registration  
- Hash the user’s password before storing them in the database.  
- successful response: Return the payload with a **`201`** success status code.
#### User Login
- Implement an endpoint for user Login.
- Use the **`JWT`** token returned to access PROTECTED endpoints.


## CREATING ORGANISATIONS
### Organisation
- A user can belong to one or more organisations
- An organisation can contain one or more users.
- On every registration, an organisation must be created.
- The name property of the organisation takes the user’s firstName and appends “Organisation” to it. For example: user’s first name is John , organisation name becomes "John's Organisation" because firstName = "John" .
- Logged in users can access organisations they belong to and organisations they created.

### Create an organisation model with the properties below.
#### Organisation Model:
```json
{
	"orgId": "string", // Unique
	"name": "string", // Required and cannot be null
	"description": "string",
}
```

## UNIT TESTING
- Write appropriate unit tests to cover
- Token generation - Ensure the token expires at the correct time and correct user details are found in the token.
- Organisation - Ensure users can’t see data from organisations they don’t have access to.
### End-to-End Test Requirements for the Register Endpoint
- The goal is to ensure the POST /auth/register endpoint works correctly by performing end-to-end tests. The tests should cover successful user registration, validation errors, and database constraints.
### Directory Structure:
- The test file should be named auth.spec.ext (ext is the file extension of your chosen language) inside a folder named tests . For example tests/auth.spec.ts assuming I’m using Typescript
#### Test Scenarios:
- It Should Register User Successfully with Default Organisation:Ensure a user is registered successfully when no organisation details are provided.
- Verify the default organisation name is correctly generated (e.g., "John's Organisation" for a user with the first name "John").
- Check that the response contains the expected user details and access token.
- It Should Log the user in successfully:Ensure a user is logged in successfully when a valid credential is provided and fails otherwise.
- Check that the response contains the expected user details and access token.
- It Should Fail If Required Fields Are Missing:Test cases for each required field (firstName, lastName, email, password) missing.
- Verify the response contains a status code of 422 and appropriate error messages.
It Should Fail if there’s Duplicate Email or UserID:Attempt to register two users with the same email.
- Verify the response contains a status code of 422 and appropriate error messages.
